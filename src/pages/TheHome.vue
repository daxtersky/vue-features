    <h1>Vue.js</h1>
    <p><strong>Vue.js</strong> is an intuivive, easy, progressive Javascript framework for building web applications.</p>
    <p>I find it a very interesting alternative to my first Javascript framework - Angular.
        Despite loving the fact how structured and organized code it required I experienced many struggles during development, because of it's complexity.
        And actually I almost never used the <a class="link" href="https://angular.io/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Angular documentation</a> and had to rely on other sources in the web.
    </p>
    <p>With <a class="link" href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js documentation</a> is different. The documentation and the framework itself is straight, clear and enjoyable to work with.
    That's why this idea of simple digital notebook from learning came up.
    </p>
    <p>Vue works on a <a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/cuHDQhDhvPE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plain JavaScript object</a> (with <a class="link" href="https://javascript.info/proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proxies</a>), instead a function or class (like other frameworks).</p>
