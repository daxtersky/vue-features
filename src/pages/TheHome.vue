    <h1>Vue.js</h1>
    <p><strong>Vue.js</strong> is an intuivive, easy, progressive Javascript framework for building web applications.</p>
    <p>I find it a very interesting alternative to my first Javascript framework - Angular.
        Despite loving the fact how structured and organized code it required I experienced many struggles during development, because of it's complexity.
        And actually I almost never used the <a class="link" href="https://angular.io/docs">official documentation</a> and had to rely on other sources in the web.</p>
